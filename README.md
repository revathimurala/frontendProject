Project Overview

This Laundry Services Frontend implements a landing page with a hero section, services listing, and booking area for an online laundry service. The page guides users from an introductory hero banner down to service selection and finally to a booking form, simulating a complete user journey for a laundry web app

Project goals

Provide an intuitive, visually appealing interface where users can view available laundry services, prices, and descriptions in one place.​

Implement an end‑to‑end booking flow: scroll from hero to services, add items, and submit a booking form that sends a confirmation message/email as specified in the assignment.​

Practice core frontend concepts such as semantic HTML structure, responsive layout with CSS, and interactive behaviour with JavaScript, including smooth scrolling and form handling.
